## Findings (established by an Experiment)

### F1 — Three numbers, three stories
Documented Sharpe 39–94 / +2–3.5%/mo (fantasy), holdout-selected +4–5%/mo (biased),
leak-free +0.1–0.34%/mo (honest). Only the last is trustworthy. See [[E1]], [[E2]], [[E3]], [[F2]], [[F3]].

### F2 — Holdout-selection bias inflates the sweep
`sweep.py` picks its winner BY the holdout score, so its "holdout" numbers are the
best-of-many on that holdout — biased. The +4–5%/mo for SOXL/LABU/TNA did NOT survive
de-biasing. Motivates [[H4]]. Evidence: [[E2]] vs [[E3]].

### F3 — [SUPERSEDED by F13] The honest edge is small but real (and decaying)
<!-- status: superseded; by: F13; reason: data-fixed; conf: 0.2 -->
Leak-free walk-forward ([[E3]]): QQQ +0.34%/mo Sh 3.74, TQQQ +0.18%/mo Sh 2.17, LABU
+0.15%, TNA +0.12%, SOXL +0.08% — sub-1% DD, ~90–112 OOS trades. Robustness ([[E4]])
shows the edge is **front-loaded into late 2025 and fades** in later folds. A near-zero-DD
~0.2–0.3%/mo vehicle, NOT a 2–3.5%/mo income engine. Bears on [[D1]].

### F4 — [SUPERSEDED by F13] QQQ (un-leveraged) is the best risk-adjusted instrument — structurally
<!-- status: superseded; by: F13; reason: data-fixed; conf: 0.2 -->
In leak-free OOS QQQ beat every 3x ETF (Sharpe 3.74, 54.5% WR). Mechanism found ([[F7]]):
it is NOT luck. Evidence: [[E3]], [[E6]]. The leverage tier is the wrong instrument class for this signal.

### F5 — Methodology note: short-slice warmup bug (fixed)
A naive walk-forward that slices each OOS window strips feature warmup → ~0 trades →
empty results. Fixed by running on `df[:fold_end]` and keeping only causal trades after
the train boundary (full warmup, no look-ahead). Lives in [[E3]].

### F6 — The live instrument (TQQQ) is fragile
TQQQ is +0.18%/mo but robustness ([[E4]]) shows it only clears significance on the default
split (pooled t≈2.1), **collapses to t=0.37 on recent-only data**, second-half t=1.03, and
has a losing fold. The live paper deployment is on a fragile, leveraged instrument. → [[D1]], [[D3]].

### F7 — THE MECHANISM: stop-vs-intrabar-noise ratio drives win rate
The same fixed ~0.7% stop is used on every instrument; the edge difference is entirely
**how often a bar's own intrabar range can trigger the stop on noise alone**, `P(bar range > stop)`:
3x ETFs **94–100%** (stop always inside noise → near coin-flip stop-outs) vs QQQ **37%**,
SPY **17%** (stop outside noise → fires only on genuine adverse moves). Across 7 instruments
`corr(stop_frac, WR) = −0.97`, `corr(noise_ratio, Sharpe) = +0.72`. Win/loss magnitudes and
R:R are ~identical across instruments — the edge is FEWER noise-stops, not bigger wins. Source: [[E6]]. Drives [[D3]].

### F8 — [SUPERSEDED by F13] The QQQ edge is a signal property, not an optimizer artifact
<!-- status: superseded; by: F13; reason: data-fixed; conf: 0.2 -->
Robustness ([[E4]]): the QQQ edge survives with a **single fixed candidate (zero parameter
selection)** — t-stat 3.3 — and across every fold count, objective, and grid width (t 3.3–4.3,
4/4 folds positive). So it is not selection overfit. Strongest evidence the edge is real. Supports [[F4]], [[D1]].

### F9 — SPY corroborates; un-leveraged broad indices are the right class
SPY (fetched fresh, vol 0.38%, noise ratio 1.83): WR 53.2%, Sharpe 2.9, +0.27%/mo —
independently corroborates QQQ. IWM (noise ratio ~1.0) lands mid-pack exactly as [[F7]]
predicts. The noise-ratio→WR relationship is continuous, not a QQQ one-off. Source: [[E6]]. → [[D3]].

### F10 — DATA CAVEAT: all results are MORNING-ONLY
The cached yfinance hourly data is truncated to ~3 bars/day (≈13–15 UTC / first 2 trading
hours). Every number in this web is the **morning-session regime**. A full-session re-pull
could shift magnitudes. → [[H5]], [[E7]].

### F13 — REVERSAL: the hourly edge was a morning-only data-sampling artifact
Re-running the leak-free walk-forward on FULL-session, live-representative data ([[F12]], [[E7]])
flips the headline: QQQ −0.05%/mo (Sh −0.75), SPY −0.05%/mo — NEGATIVE. The +0.34%/mo QQQ
edge ([[F3]], [[F4]], [[F8]]) only existed on the morning-only (3 bars/day) cache. Since the live
bot trades full sessions, this is exactly why it is FLAT. SUPERSEDES [[F3|supersedes]], [[F4|supersedes]], [[F8|supersedes]], [[F9|supersedes]] for the
hourly timescale. The instrument mechanism [[F7]] still holds for the leveraged-ETF failure. → [[D4]].

### F14 — The edge tracks BAR-SAMPLING FREQUENCY, not time-of-day or instrument
Decomposition on full-session data: QQQ AM(3 bars/day) +0.34%/mo Sh 3.72; QQQ PM(4 bars/day)
+0.32%/mo Sh 3.31; QQQ ALL-DAY(7 bars/day) −0.05%/mo Sh −0.75. AM ≈ PM (so NOT time-of-day),
but both ≫ ALL-DAY. RSI(7)/MACD on ~3 bars/day spans ~2 trading days → captures multi-day
mean-reversion (edge); on 7 bars/day it spans ~1 day → intraday noise (no edge). The signal has
edge at a COARSE (~daily) timescale and none at the HOURLY timescale the bot runs. → [[H7]], [[D4]].
CAVEAT: hour-subsampling also recomputes indicators on a coarser series — the clean confirmation
is a real DAILY-bar test ([[E9]]), not just hour-filtering.

### F15 — The edge is REAL at ~3 bars/day; the live bot just trades the wrong frequency
E9 (same full-session data, proper OHLC resample to N bars/day): QQQ at **3 bars/day = +0.37%/mo,
Sharpe 4.15, DD −0.6%** (≈4.5% APY — the conservative goal); SPY 3/day +0.22%/mo Sh 2.43. But at
7 bars/day (hourly, what the LIVE bot trades) both are NEGATIVE; at 2/day weaker; 1/day (pure daily)
too sparse over 2yr to test ([[E9]]). The robustness work ([[E4]]) already showed the 3/day regime
survives zero parameter selection (t>3). So the QQQ/SPY edge is genuine at the ~3-bars/day (multi-day
mean-reversion) timescale and absent hourly — F3/F4's numbers were this 3/day regime, mislabeled as
"hourly". ACTIONABLE LEVER: sample ~3 bars/day (≈every 2h), not hourly. CAVEAT: DIA INVERTS (positive
hourly, negative 3/day) → instrument-dependent, not universal; needs multi-instrument + multi-regime
confirmation. Refines [[F13|refines]] (hourly-negative still holds) and [[F14|refines]]. → [[D4]], [[H7]].

### F16 — Daily mean-reversion is REAL (model-free, not an artifact)
12yr daily data (2014–2026, n≈3030): lag-1 autocorrelation SPY −0.117 (t −6.4), QQQ −0.105 (t −5.8),
DIA −0.125 (t −6.9), IWM −0.061 (t −3.3); variance ratios <1 at all horizons. The 3x ETFs have the
SAME serial correlation as their 1x parents (leverage is irrelevant to the edge). Unlike the hourly
"edge" ([[F13]]), this is a genuine statistical property of the price series, not a sampling artifact.
CAVEAT: in the 2022 bear, lag-1 ACF collapses to ~0 — the edge VANISHES in sustained downtrends
(→ must sit out bears; the slope-regime gate already does some of this). Source: daily-history agent ([[E9]]). → [[F17]], [[D4]].

### F17 — THE EXIT IS THE ARCHITECTURAL FLAW (fixed %-stop kills mean-reversion)
The fixed %-target/%-stop exit used everywhere destroys the real mean-reversion edge ([[F16]]) at BOTH
timescales — it exits winning trades on intraband noise before the bounce completes (daily WR 34–41%,
below the 2:1 breakeven, half the instruments negative). Root-cause isolation (leak-free daily WF):
swapping the %-stop for a multi-day HORIZON (time) exit flips EVERY instrument positive — **QQQ +1.99%
APY, Sharpe 0.74, −8% DD, survives 2022**. Cost is not the bottleneck (QQQ holds +1.74% APY at 10bps,
5× spread). This UNIFIES the flat hourly bot ([[F13]]) and the daily result: the signal is fine; the
exit is wrong. ACTIONABLE: replace %-stop with a horizon/time exit for the mean-reversion strategy. → [[D4]], [[H8]].

### F12 — ROOT CAUSE of the morning-only data + a backtest↔live data mismatch
The morning-only data ([[F10]]) is a yfinance quirk: a 1h fetch over a LONG (~710-day) range
returns only ~3 bars/day (the open, 13–15 UTC), but the SAME data fetched in ≤250-day chunks
returns FULL 7-bar sessions (13–20 UTC). Crucially: the **live bot fetches a short ~40-day
window** (`live/signals.py::_fetch_recent_bars`, `trading_days_needed*2`) → it trades on
FULL-session data; but **every backtest/sweep fetched ~710 days → morning-only**. So all
validation to date used a DIFFERENT (thinner, open-only) data distribution than the live bot
actually trades on — a serious backtest↔live gap. Fixed by `tools/fetch_fullsession.py`
(chunked re-pull, ~3× the bars). Re-running [[E3]]/screen on full-session data is [[E7]]. Supersedes the caveat in [[F10]].

### F11 — Penalty-inversion selection bug (fixed)
The sweep scorer multiplied a NEGATIVE base by penalty factors <1, moving it toward zero —
i.e. it *improved* losing configs, so among net-negative candidates it preferred the
worst-behaved one. Guarded (penalties skip base ≤ 0). Mattered precisely in the no-edge
regime this research operates in. Fixed in commit 084f15e.

## Hypotheses

### H1 — RESOLVED: edge is sample-luck? → NO for QQQ, YES for TQQQ
Robustness ([[E4]]): QQQ robust (t 3.3–4.3, survives no-selection [[F8]]); TQQQ fragile ([[F6]]). Closed.

### H2 — RESOLVED: un-leveraged indices generalize the edge? → YES
Confirmed by the noise-ratio mechanism [[F7]] + SPY/IWM corroboration [[F9]] ([[E6]]). Closed → [[D3]].

### H3 — RESOLVED: edge can be cheaply lifted (ATR stops / entry quality)? → NO
Lever test ([[E5]]): ATR-1.5× helps QQQ marginally (Sh 3.74→4.09) but HURTS TQQQ (2.17→1.30)
— sign-inconsistent, fragile; the asymmetry itself corroborates [[F7]]. require_signals=2
starves trades (2–6 OOS). Neither is a reliable lift. Closed.

### H4 — OPEN: walk-forward should be the sweep's PRIMARY selector (C5)
Single-split holdout selection is biased ([[F2]]); rolling-origin OOS ([[E3]]) is honest.
Promote it inside the sweep. → [[D2]].

### H5 — OPEN: does the edge hold on FULL-session data (not morning-only)?
All current evidence is the morning regime ([[F10]]). Re-pull full-session hourly data and
re-run [[E3]] across instruments. Could change magnitudes and the instrument ranking. → [[E7]].

### H7 — OPEN (most promising): the edge lives at the DAILY timescale, not hourly
[[F14]] shows the mean-reversion edge appears at ~daily/multi-day bar spacing and vanishes
hourly. Test a clean DAILY-bar mean-reversion strategy (more history → more regimes, lower
trade count → lower cost → inherently more conservative). The project's original BTC_DAILY mode
had the best Sharpe / lowest DD — possibly the real thing before the hourly pivot chased a
sampling artifact. → [[E9]]. Directly bears on the conservative goal [[D4]].

### H8 — OPEN (the path to the goal): diversified daily-MR sleeves with a horizon exit
[[F17]] gives a real ~2% APY / −8% DD on a single broad index (QQQ) — about HALF the 3.75% target. To
reach 3.75% at acceptable drawdown without leverage (forbidden by the DD mandate), combine several
low-correlation daily mean-reversion sleeves (SPY/QQQ/DIA/IWM + maybe sector ETFs), each with a horizon
exit + the slope-regime bear gate, and measure the PORTFOLIO Sharpe/DD. Diversification should cut DD
for the same return. → builds on [[F16]], [[F17]]; resolves [[D4]].

### H6 — OPEN: screen instruments by noise-ratio to find where the signal works
[[F7]] gives a one-number predictor (`P(bar range > stop) < ~0.5`, i.e. noise_ratio > 1) of
where this mean-reversion edge survives. Screen a broad universe (large-cap, low-vol ETFs/
indices) by it, then leak-free-validate the top candidates. → operationalized by [[E8]].

## Experiments

### E1 — Documented optimistic sweep (historical) → artifact, feeds [[F1]].
### E2 — Fixed-10% realistic HOLDOUT sweep (2026-06-19)
`sweep.py TICKER --sizing fixed --fixed-pct 0.10 --mode realistic`. Biased by holdout selection ([[F2]]). Feeds [[F1]].
### E3 — Leak-free walk-forward (PRIMARY evidence)
`tools/walkforward_eval.py`. Produced [[F3]], [[F4]], [[F5]], [[F6]].
### E4 — RESOLVED: edge robustness & confidence
QQQ robust (t 3.3–4.3, survives zero-selection), TQQQ fragile (t 0.37 on recent data); both
decay over time. Inert to folds/objective; survives grid width. Resolved [[H1]], produced [[F6]], [[F8]].
### E5 — RESOLVED: edge-lift levers
ATR stops + require_signals=2 in leak-free OOS. Neither lifts the edge reliably. Resolved [[H3]].
### E6 — RESOLVED: QQQ structural deep-dive + SPY/IWM
Exit-type decomposition + noise-ratio across 7 instruments + SPY/IWM fetch. Produced the
mechanism [[F7]], [[F9]]; resolved [[H2]], explained [[F4]].
### E7 — IN PROGRESS: full-session data re-pull & re-validate (now matches live)
`tools/fetch_fullsession.py` rebuilds full-session 1h data (root cause [[F12]]). Gathering a
conservative universe (broad indices + low-vol/dividend + bond ETFs). Then re-run the
noise-ratio screen [[E8]] + leak-free walk-forward [[E3]] on data that finally matches what the
live bot trades. Resolves [[H5]]; feeds the conservative-target question [[D4]].
### E8 — DONE: noise-ratio instrument screener
`tools/instrument_screen.py` — ranks a universe by `P(bar range > stop)`. On full-session data:
bonds ultra-friendly (but target unreachable), indices friendly, leveraged noise-dominated.
The screen is necessary-not-sufficient (doesn't test target reachability or timescale [[F14]]).

### E9 — DONE (part 1): edge vs bar-duration on resampled full-session data
Produced [[F15]]: QQQ/SPY edge peaks at ~3 bars/day (QQQ +0.37%/mo Sh 4.15), negative hourly,
DIA inverts. Pure daily (1/day) too sparse over 2yr. Part 2 (multi-year DAILY bars across regimes
incl. 2022 bear) is in progress via a research agent — the decisive long-history daily test.

## Decisions / Gates

### D1 — Edge go/no-go (roadmap gate #1) — UPDATED
Net edge is ~0.2–0.34%/mo OOS — below the ~0.5%/mo income threshold, so this is NOT an income
engine. BUT it is a **genuine, structurally-explained, near-zero-drawdown high-Sharpe vehicle on
the right instrument** ([[F3]], [[F4]], [[F7]], [[F8]], [[F9]]) — exactly the "bond-ETF alternative"
the project set out to be. Verdict: **don't kill it — reframe it** as a capital-preservation /
high-Sharpe product AND **switch instrument focus from 3x ETFs to un-leveraged broad indices**.
Caveats: morning-only data ([[F10]]), edge decaying ([[F3]]), TQQQ fragile ([[F6]]).

### D2 — Promote walk-forward to primary selector (C5)
Make the sweep select on rolling-origin OOS, not single-split holdout ([[H4]]). Now well-motivated
([[E4]] shows the lens is stable). Needs a design pass on integration with the 5-phase sweep.

### D3 — Adopt the noise-ratio instrument rule; make QQQ/SPY first-class candidates
Actionable design rule from [[F7]]: **only deploy this signal where `stop_pct` > median intraday
bar range (noise_ratio > 1)**. Concretely: (1) run full sweeps on QQQ + SPY (+ IWM check) as
production candidates; (2) build the screener [[E8]] to apply the rule to a wider universe; (3) do
NOT size up the leveraged ETFs on this architecture. NOTE: changing the live instrument touches the
armed trader path — requires sign-off; this node records the evidence-backed recommendation, not an applied change.

### D4 — is the original ~3.75% APY conservative goal achievable? — UPDATED (sobering)
3.75% APY ≈ +0.307%/mo. The earlier "yes on QQQ" was a data artifact ([[F13]]). On full-session,
live-representative data the HOURLY mean-reversion architecture has NO reliable edge on any
instrument tested (QQQ/SPY negative; bonds: target unreachable; leveraged: noise-dominated [[F7]]).
DEFINITIVE ANSWER (12yr daily, model-free + leak-free): daily mean-reversion is REAL ([[F16]]), but the
project's fixed %-stop EXIT destroys it ([[F17]]); a multi-day HORIZON exit recovers it. With the fix,
**QQQ ≈ +2% APY, Sharpe 0.74, −8% DD, regime-robust (survives 2022)** — about HALF the 3.75% target on
a single index. 3.75% at acceptable drawdown requires DIVERSIFYING several low-correlation daily-MR
sleeves ([[H8]]) — NOT leverage (the 3x ETFs hit 3.75%+ but at −25% to −40% DD and invert in bears,
violating the capital-preservation mandate). So: **the goal is reachable, but as a diversified DAILY
mean-reversion product with a horizon exit and a bear gate — not the hourly %-stop bot.** Concrete next
build: daily MR + time/horizon exit + slope-regime gate, multi-instrument portfolio ([[H8]]). The
single highest-value change is the EXIT ([[F17]]). (1-bars/day hourly note [[F15]] is the weaker, less
robust cousin; the daily horizon-exit result supersedes it as the recommended direction.)

## Strategy Lab — leverage-free daily-MR (2026-06-22, independent replication + extension)

> Reproducible harness: `tools/mr_daily_lab.py` (read-only; yfinance daily, 2014–2026).

### E10 — Independent daily-MR replication + strategy lab
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.85; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Model-free, leak-free harness (`tools/mr_daily_lab.py`) on 12yr adjusted daily data:
lag-1 autocorrelation + variance ratios; dip entry (buy the close of a down day) with
horizon vs fixed %-stop exits; diversified multi-sleeve portfolios; long-only
cross-sectional sector rotation; conditional entries; vol-targeted vs adaptive-Kelly
sizing; bond signal tests. Produces [[F18|produces]], [[F19|produces]], [[F20|produces]],
[[F21|produces]]; extends the daily direction of [[E9|supports]].

### F18 — F16 replicates exactly, but its significance was ~3× overstated
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.8; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Independent 12yr daily ([[E10|evidenced_by]]) reproduces F16's lag-1 autocorrelations
almost exactly (SPY −0.113 vs −0.117, QQQ −0.100, DIA −0.122, IWM −0.058) and variance
ratios <1. BUT F16's naive `t = ρ√n` ignores volatility clustering; under a
heteroskedasticity-robust SE the t-stats fall ~3× (SPY −6.3→−2.2, IWM −1.7 = n.s.), and
non-overlapping trades leave only QQQ at t>2. So the mean-reversion structure is REAL but
**modest**, not overwhelming. The 2022-bear collapse is confirmed (ρ→0, |t|<1 for all).
Refines [[F16|refines]].

### F19 — Confirmed: the EXIT, not the entry, is the dominant lever
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.85; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Within-comparison on identical dip entries ([[E10|evidenced_by]]): a 5-day HORIZON exit
yields +29 bps/trade on SPY (+38 QQQ, +80 TQQQ), while a fixed ±0.8% stop/target yields
−2 bps (−27 TQQQ, 36% WR) — same entry, opposite sign. The tight band is whipsawed inside
daily noise, worst on 3× ETFs. Independently confirms [[F17|supports]] and unifies it with
the noise-ratio mechanism [[F7|supports]]. The horizon exit does NOT rescue the 2022 bear
(3× −166/−346 bps/trade) → the regime gate is non-negotiable, independent of exit.

### F20 — What does NOT work (four negative results)
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.8; at: 2026-06-22 -->
From the lab ([[E10|evidenced_by]]): (1) **long-only cross-sectional** sector rotation
(buy the most-oversold of 9 SPDRs) underperforms sector buy&hold (Sharpe 0.44 vs 0.65,
−43% DD) — it loads falling knives; real cross-sectional MR needs the forbidden short leg.
(2) **Sizing — the estimator SHAPE matters** (corrected after review): a *continuous*
textbook half-Kelly HURTS (QQQ Sharpe 0.72→0.48) because its fraction (CV 0.77) chases the
noisy win/loss-ratio `b`. BUT that is a strawman for the project's LIVE `adaptive_kelly_multiplier`
— a coarse 4-tier *win-rate* step that never computes `b` (CV 0.23): re-run on the same trades
it is ~Sharpe-NEUTRAL (0.68 ≈ the fixed baseline), neither helping nor hurting (and it is bypassed
on the active fixed-sizing path). So only a noisy continuous Kelly is harmful; vol-targeting is the
sizing that actively helps (0.56→0.67).
(3) **Low-vol entry filtering** hurts (Sharpe 0.56→0.26): the biggest dips revert hardest.
(4) **Bond signal-trading** (corrected): the 200d *equity* bear gate is wrong-signed for
(anti-correlated) bonds — gated, TLT/IEF dips lose to B&H; UN-gated, a TLT dip beats B&H
(Sharpe 0.19 vs 0.10, lower DD) but insignificantly (bootstrap straddles 0) and IEF still loses.
Net: hold bonds as PASSIVE ballast (the −0.09 equity correlation), not for a signal edge.
Relates the noise mechanism [[F7|relates]].

### F21 — The honest leverage-free ceiling + the recommended build
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.8; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Best leverage-free config ([[E10|evidenced_by]]): EQUAL-WEIGHT diversified daily-MR sleeves
(equities + gold + passive-bond ballast) + 200d bear gate + VOL-TARGETED (not Kelly) sizing
→ ~Sharpe 0.66, ~4%/yr, −10% DD. "Smart" trailing-Sharpe weighting underperforms equal-weight
(0.42 vs 0.66). The ~3.75% target is reachable only by levering the low-vol (~6%) portfolio
to a vol target (≈5.8%/yr at 1.5×, −19% DD) — you buy return with drawdown, not Sharpe. So
leverage-free daily-MR is a solid BALANCED strategy (Sharpe ~0.6, equity-like DD), NOT a
near-zero-DD bond alternative — that headline was the morning-only artifact. Refines
[[H8|refines]] and [[D4|refines]]; drives [[D5|drives]].

### D5 — Recommended next architecture (the leverage-free daily-MR product)
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.7; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Build: equal-weight portfolio of daily mean-reversion sleeves on un-leveraged equities
(QQQ/SPY/IWM/DIA) + gold (GLD), each = buy-the-dip + multi-day HORIZON exit + slope/200d
bear gate, with VOL-TARGETED position sizing and passive bond ballast for correlation.
DROP, on evidence: the hourly timescale, the fixed %-stop exit, 3× leverage, and long-only
cross-sectional rotation. PREFER vol-targeted sizing (it lifts Sharpe); the live WR-tiered
adaptive-Kelly is ~Sharpe-neutral so keep-or-replace is a wash (only a noisy *continuous*
Kelly is harmful — [[F20]]). Expected ~Sharpe 0.6, ~4%/yr leverage-free
(or ~6% vol-targeted at higher DD). Builds on [[F19|builds_on]], [[F20|builds_on]];
relates the hourly/leverage evidence [[F13|relates]], [[F7|relates]]. Refines [[D4|refines]].
NOTE: changing the live instrument/exit/sizing touches the armed trader path — sign-off
required; this records the evidence-backed recommendation, not an applied change.
⚠ OOS UPDATE ([[F22]]): a walk-forward stress test shows this build does NOT beat buy&hold
risk-adjusted (Sharpe 0.69 vs 0.80) — its value is capital-preservation via reduced exposure,
which a static equity/cash blend achieves more simply at higher Sharpe. So D5 stands only as a
low-drawdown CAPITAL-PRESERVATION overlay; the go/no-go for an *active* alpha engine is negative.

### E11 — Out-of-sample / walk-forward stress test of the D5 build
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.85; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Stress-tested the D5 equal-weight daily-MR portfolio (QQQ/SPY/IWM/DIA/GLD, dip+5d+200d gate,
net 5bps) against an equal-weight BUY&HOLD of the same 5 assets: per-calendar-year, first-half
vs second-half, held-out COVID-2020 + 2022-bear regimes, and a 20-day block bootstrap of the
per-day Sharpe difference. Reproducible: `tools/mr_daily_lab.py oos`. Produces [[F22|produces]].

### F22 — OOS verdict: the daily-MR timing has NO risk-adjusted edge over buy&hold
<!-- status: current; conf: 0.8; at: 2026-06-22 -->
Stress test ([[E11|evidenced_by]]): the D5 equal-weight daily-MR portfolio scores Sharpe 0.69
vs **0.80 for an equal-weight BUY&HOLD of the same 5 assets**, and the 20-day block bootstrap of
the per-day Sharpe DIFFERENCE is [−1.12, −0.05] (`tools/mr_daily_lab.py oos`, seed 0) — the timing
is *significantly WORSE* risk-adjusted (upper bound just below 0). NOT front-loaded (2nd-half Sharpe 0.94 > 1st-half
0.42), so the negative is robust, not a one-period artifact. What timing buys is REDUCED EXPOSURE:
~half the return (6.2% vs 12.1%) at ~half the drawdown (−13.9% vs −29.5%), 87% time-in-market.
Its only edge is defensive in SLOW bears (2022 −8% vs −17%); it fails in FAST crashes (COVID
≈−11% both — the 200d gate is too slow). DECISIVE: a static ~50/50 equity/cash blend has the SAME
Sharpe as full buy&hold (0.80; cash-scaling is Sharpe-invariant) at the timing strategy's return/DD
— so daily-MR timing is DOMINATED by trivial static de-risking. This is the same lesson as the
hourly arc ([[F13|relates]]): a flattering backtest number that doesn't survive the honest
benchmark. Refines [[F21|refines]] and [[D5|refines]]; bears on the go/no-go [[D1|drives]], [[D4|drives]].
